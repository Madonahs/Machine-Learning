I will try using a  different model
Machine learning algorithms:
Linear Algorithms:
Algorithm 1: Linear Regression
Algorithm 2: Logistic Regression
Algorithm 3: Linear Discriminant Analysis
*Nonlinear Algorithms:

Algorithm 4: Classification and Regression Trees
Algorithm 5: Naive Bayes
Algorithm 6: K-Nearest Neighbors
Algorithm 7: Learning Vector Quantization
Algorithm 8: Support Vector Machines
*Ensemble Algorithms:

Algorithm 9: Bagged Decision Trees and Random Forest
Algorithm 10: Boosting and AdaBoost
