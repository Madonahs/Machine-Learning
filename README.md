**This repository was created for educational purposes. It will host a number of projects as part of the process and some exercises that we created.**


## Intro

### Project A

With an upsurge in cybercrimes related to Sim Card Swap fraud in developing countries, making fraud detection is a top priority. If we are able to estimate whether someone is going to commit Sim Card Fraud we can surely try to prevent it earlier. 

## Intro

Predicting the likelihood of Sim Card Swap Fraud Occurrence.
* **Train and test the data samples**
* **Normalize and summarize the data**

### Mode
Develop

### Implementations

* **Define Problem**
* **Prepare Data**
* **Evaluate Algorithms**
* **Improve Results**
* **Present Results**

### Usage

Sim Card Swap Fraud Detection.

### Model

* **Logistic Regression.** Logistic regression is the appropriate regression analysis to conduct when the dependent variable is dichotomous (binary). Like all regression analyses, the logistic regression is a predictive analysis.


## Data

### Sample Dataset

There can be many factors as to why someone would want to swap his/her sim card, I will just use few. The swap will be represented by 
```1``` and 
```0``` will represent not swapped. I created this data for this exercise.

Sample Output Representation: 

Swap | Not Swapped|
|------ |------:|
|1 | 0|

* **Sample Fake Data taken from Nairobi, Kenya constituencies**
Data is not given in this case so I decided to create my own, I will identify Locations here and not use the Location since we can have many customers living in the same Location.
